#### Features:
	
- Lagrange's Theorem
- Plane vs Point Function
- Line Segment vs Plane Function
- Triangle vs Plane Function
- Triangle Slicing with OpenGL
- Find Shortest Distance between two capsules
- Find Collison of Point On A Triangle
- Javeillin Throw Calculator
- Cannon Aim Angle Calculator
- SAT Polygon Collsion

#### Controls:

##### Capsule:
	R - RESET SCENE
	ENTER - DRAW LINE BETWEEN CAPSULES
	DRAW CAPSULE:
		CLICK ONCE TO SET FIRST POINT
		CLICK AGAIN TO SET RADIUS
		CLICK AGAIN TO SET SECOND POINT
##### Triangle Slicer
	R - RESET SCENE
	ENTER - SLICE
	T - RESET TRIANGLES
	L - RESET LINE
	
##### Triangle Point Collision
	R - RESET SCENE
	FIRST 3 CLICKS DRAWS THE TRIANGLE
	FOURTH CLICK DRAWS THE POINT
	AN "I" WILL RENDER IF THE POINT IS INSIDE AND AN "O" WILL RENDER IF IT IS ON THE OUTSIDE
##### SAT Collision
	R - RESET SCENE
	FIRST 5 CLICKS DRAWS A POLYGON
	SECOND 5 CLIKCS DRAWS SECOND POLYGON
	AN "I" WILL RENDER IF THERE IS COLLISION AND A "N" WILL RENDER IF IT IS NOT COLLIDING
